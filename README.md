Website workshop: might one day make this my portfolio or something.

Update as of 1/13/20: I now plan to use this as a website portfolio. I've added my initial resources and built this thing on my own.

Update as of 1/14/20: Fixed minor glitches on website. Overall stable.

To Do: 
    Look for more stuff to add in this order:
        - What should be on a portfolio site
        - What cool features exist
